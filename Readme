Modeling and Analysis of High Level Petri nets.

Analysis Method: 
  1) Simulation;
  2) SPIN Model Checker;
  3) Z3 SMT Checker.

Above information is coming from original PIPE+ software.
For Timed PIPE+, what we added into the original PIPE+:
1. Add arriving time attribute into token.
2. Add lowerbound and upperbound into transition.
3. Sort the tokens in the list automatically once added.
4. Add global time implementation and show it up on the GUI.
5. Modify the animator logic to update token's arriving time, when it tranfer from one place to another.
6. After each round animation, it will automatically scan all the outdated token, then re-new the arriving time.
